# Python-Notebook
This is a personal notebook for the python libraries that I've worked and learnt.

For the full feature experience, run it on a local host server. I use Pycharm to open it.

The main file to open is "Python Notebook.html" and also there is an old version ("old - Python Notebook") which I didn't update it. (It doesn't need to run on localhost.)
